#### Backend Optimizations
- **WebSocket Pooling**: Efficient connection management
- **Audio Streaming**: Direct binary data transfer
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic reconnection handling
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of inactive connections

## Running Performance Tests

### Automated Testing
\`\`\`bash
cd scripts
node performance-test.js
\`\`\`

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Reconnection works automatically
- [ ] Error handling displays appropriate messages

#### Audio Quality
- [ ] Clear audio input/output
- [ ] No echo or feedback
- [ ] Noise suppression working
- [ ] Volume levels appropriate

#### Latency Testing
- [ ] Response time under 2 seconds
- [ ] Interruption works smoothly
- [ ] No audio artifacts or delays
- [ ] Real-time audio level indicators

#### User Experience
- [ ] Intuitive microphone button behavior
- [ ] Clear status indicators
- [ ] Performance metrics accurate
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### High Latency (>3 seconds)
1. Check internet connection speed
2. Verify Gemini API key and model
3. Switch to development model for testing
4. Monitor server logs for bottlenecks

### Connection Issues
1. Verify WebSocket server is running on port 3001
2. Check CORS configuration
3. Ensure proper SSL/TLS for production
4. Monitor connection pool limits

### Audio Quality Problems
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Verify audio codec support
3. Adjust sample rate settings
4. Test with different browsers

### Memory Leaks
1. Monitor connection cleanup
2. Check audio context disposal
3. Verify WebSocket closure
4. Review performance metrics history

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Performance
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] CDN configured for static assets
- [ ] WebSocket connection limits set
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

### Security
- [ ] API keys secured in environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS/WSS enabled
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented

### Scalability
- [ ] Horizontal scaling tested
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented
- [ ] Auto-scaling configured

## Monitoring in Production

### Key Metrics to Track
- Average response latency
- Connection success rate
- Audio quality scores
- Error rates and types
- User session duration

### Alerting Thresholds
- Latency > 3 seconds
- Error rate > 5%
- Connection failures > 10%
- Audio quality < 80%

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Use CDN**: Serve static assets from edge locations
2. **Optimize Audio**: Use appropriate codecs and bitrates
3. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse WebSocket connections
4. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous performance monitoring
6. **Testing**: Regular load and stress testing
